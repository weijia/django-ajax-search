Customize
=========

You will need to define the position of the dropdown list for instant-search.    

In the template where you need the dropdown displayed, include this code in the body::
    
    <div id='searchdropdown'></div>

In the media/css folder, open the **ajax-search.css** file. Therein you'll find specifications for the very first element called **searchdropdown**. Uncomment the lines and define it's position according to your needs.     
    
You may also make other changes to the CSS file to change the look and feel of the components.    
    
Your search is now set-up. Try it by typing in the search-box.    
    
In case of any issues, include the issue on Github after searching existing ones. You may also join and mail to the django-ajax-search Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/django-ajax-search .
