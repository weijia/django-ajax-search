A customizable AJAX-powered search for Django.

Features

- Displays instant search results as you type


Installation Requirements
-----------------------------------

- Python 2.6 or Python 2.7
- `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ >= 1.3
- `jQuery <http://jquery.com/>`_ >= 1.4.4

.. note::

    Begining with version django-selectable version 0.6, Django 1.2 is no longer supported.
    While it may continue to work, bugs related to Django 1.2 support will not be fixed.

To install::
    
    pip install django-selectable

Next add `selectable` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` to include the related css/js::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'contrib.staticfiles',
        # Other apps here
        'selectable',
    )

The jQuery and jQuery UI libraries are not included in the distribution but must be included
in your templates. See the example project for an example using these libraries from the
Google CDN.

Once installed you should add the urls to your root url patterns::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # Other patterns go here
        (r'^selectable/', include('selectable.urls')),
    )
